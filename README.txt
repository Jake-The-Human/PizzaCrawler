this is a modified webcrawer i made after watching the newBoston python tutorials on a webcrawlers. I call this one the pizza crawler.
you give it the number of pages you want it to search, a town, and the state you want it to search. Note: state needs to be
2 letters long both being caps. the web crawler uses Yellow Pages to find url.

also got the crazy cool ascii art from this generator:
